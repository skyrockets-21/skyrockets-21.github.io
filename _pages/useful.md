*Last Updated: July 7, 2023* 

I enjoyed doing Healthcare ML a lot! And to create real *useful* ML applications in healthcare, understanding the data and having some domain knowledge is very important (I disagree with how some view ML/DL as a magic turnkey, one-size-fits-all solution). Below are some resources I find very useful from the trenches of healthcare ML research. This is by no means an exhaustive list and there is so much to learn in the domain of healthcare if you wish to become a successful data scientist/ML researcher!
