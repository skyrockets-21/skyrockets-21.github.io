Aspired to an impactful AI career in healthcare/biomedicine, I am currently working on various ML research projects with professors at CMU, UIUC, with hands-on experience in building ML pipelines to preprocess multimodal data ranging from EHRs and insurance claims to MRIs; and training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models with PyTorch/TensorFlow.

May 2023 Update: Passionate about Responsible AI in Healthcare/Biomedicine, recently I have been selected by the Jewish Healthcare Foundation as a Feinstein Patient Safety Fellow to work on patient safety issues in the US! 

Skills: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistics, Project Management, Python, PyTorch, SQL, AWS, Spark, Biomedical Data
