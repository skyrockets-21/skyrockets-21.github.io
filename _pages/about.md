I am an ML in healthcare and biomedicine researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and it is my pleasure to have  Professor [Jimeng Sun](http://sunlab.org/), Professor [Wei Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weiwu2/), Professor [Haohan Wang](https://haohanwang.github.io/index.html), and Professor [George H. Chen](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) as my supervisors/advisors.

Aspired to an impactful AI career in healthcare, I am currently working on two ML research projects in healthcare/biomedicine with hands-on experience in building ML pipelines to preprocess multimodal data ranging from EHRs and insurance claims to brain MRIs; and training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models with PyTorch. I am also a [Feinstein Patient Safety Fellow](https://www.patientsafetytech.com/fellowship/) at the Jewish Healthcare Foundation working to enhance patient safety with AI.

Previously, I received from Carnegie Mellon University my master's degree in data analytics in May 2023 and my bachelor's degree in Economics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2013🚀. I also have years of experience in product and project management in the internet/fintech industry at companies such as Tencent.
