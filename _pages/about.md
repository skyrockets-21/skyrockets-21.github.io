Hi 👋! I am a self-driven 🔥🚀 Machine Learning for Healthcare⚕️ Researcher🧑‍💻 at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and AI Entrepreneur🚀 . It has been my pleasure to have Professor [George H. Chen†](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) and Professor [Wei Wu†](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weiwu2/) at CMU and Professor [Jimeng Sun†](http://sunlab.org/) and Professor [Haohan Wang†](https://haohanwang.github.io/index.html) at UIUC as my supervisors/advisors!

Aspired to an impactful AI career in healthcare, I am currently working on two ML research projects in healthcare/biomedicine with hands-on experience in building robust ML pipelines to preprocess multimodal data ranging from EHRs and insurance claims to brain MRIs; and training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models with PyTorch. I am also a [Feinstein Patient Safety Fellow](https://www.patientsafetytech.com/fellowship/) at the Jewish Healthcare Foundation working to enhance patient safety with AI. Interested in Data Science for Social Good, previously I worked as Data Scientist at [412 Food Rescue](https://412foodrescue.org/)/[Food Rescue Hero](https://foodrescuehero.org/), a tech startup fighting the nationwide food insecurity problem. 

Before receiving my master's degree in Data Analytics and Public Policy from CMU this May, I did my bachelor's degree in Economics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2013. I also have years of experience in Product and Project Management in the internet/fintech industry at companies such as [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/index.html)
