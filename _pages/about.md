üëã Hi! I am a **Healthcare AI Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and NASA**. My passion focuses on solving our biomedicine and healthcare problems with AI. My current work spans Alzheimer's Disease dementia detection, Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) risk prediction, and clinical information retrieval and natural language processing. I graduated with my master's degree in public policy and data analytics at CMU's Heinz College. Before CMU, I worked in product management and strategy in the internet and telecom industry in Hong Kong.

üí°Highlights:
---
- **UCSF**
  - Awarded third place at the [QBI Hackathon](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/qbi-hackathon-2023) organized by UCSF Quantitative Biosciences Institute! We are continuing the project and are happy to have UC Berkeley Professor Abby Dernburg and Professor Nicholas Ingolia as our advisors!
- **Poster - Microsoft Research**
  - Presented a Poster [MedAI: Addressing Healthcare Burnout with AI-Powered Solution](https://ir-ai.github.io/images/4.pdf) at the Task Focused IR in the Era of Generative AI workshop co-hosted by Microsoft Research and the Univ. of Washington!

Hi üëã! I am a self-driven üî•üöÄ Machine Learning for Healthcare Researcher at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and AI EntrepreneurüöÄ . It has been my pleasure to have Professor [George H. Chen‚Ä†](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/) and Professor [Wei Wu‚Ä†](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weiwu2/) at CMU and Professor [Jimeng Sun‚Ä†](http://sunlab.org/) and Professor [Haohan Wang‚Ä†](https://haohanwang.github.io/index.html) at UIUC as my supervisors/advisors!

Aspired to an impactful AI career in healthcare, I am currently working on two ML research projects in healthcare/biomedicine with hands-on experience in building robust ML pipelines to preprocess multimodal data ranging from EHRs and insurance claims to brain MRIs; and training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models with PyTorch. I am also a [Feinstein Patient Safety Fellow](https://www.patientsafetytech.com/fellowship/) at the Jewish Healthcare Foundation working to enhance patient safety with AI. Interested in Data Science for Social Good, previously I worked as Data Scientist at [412 Food Rescue](https://412foodrescue.org/)/[Food Rescue Hero](https://foodrescuehero.org/), a tech startup fighting the nationwide food insecurity problem. 

Before receiving my master's degree in Data Analytics and Public Policy from CMU this May, I did my bachelor's degree in Economics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2013. I also have years of experience in Product and Project Management in the internet/fintech industry at companies such as [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/index.html)
